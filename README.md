# AllsvenskanGamePredictor
ETL - project to analyze allsvenskan games

Step 1: Develop a web scraping method to collect data about the last three seasons of "Allsvenskan," including a wide range of information on match results and game statistics. I implemented this using a Jupyter Notebook named scraping.ipynb. After extracting the data, I saved it as a CSV file for further use.
