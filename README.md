# AllsvenskanGamePredictor
ETL - project to analyze allsvenskan games

Step 1: 
  Create a webscraping method that retrieve data about the 3 last seasons in "Allsvenskan", with many different data about results and statistics from the games. I did it with my Jupyter notebook called "scraping.ipynb" and then i saved it as a csv file.
